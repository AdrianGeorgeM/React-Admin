# React-Admin
React-Admin app based on an existing REST API


It runs in the browser, and fetches data from an API. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

I used JSONPlaceholder, a fake REST API designed for testing and prototyping, as the data source for the application.

JSONPlaceholder provides endpoints for users, posts, and comments. 
The admin i builded should allow to Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) these resources.

For running the app 
yarn dev
